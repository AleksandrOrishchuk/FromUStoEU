"From US to EU" converter app, my personal project.

It is a dynamic and responsive Android application that performs instant 2-way conversions between commonly used Metric and Imperial measure units and also supports conversions between several popular world currencies and United States Dollars.

The main idea is based on simplicity for app's users to quickly get all commonly-desired conversion results. 
The app immediately shows conversion results and refreshes them as user types a numeric value in a central "Number" field. Then, all they have to do is just look up for desired measure unit in a easy to read table on screen, no other taps on buttons or messing with boring drop-down menus needed. The only switch-button involved in user's interaction is direction button, it also instantly refreshes conversion results and has only two states “US” and “EURO” that represent source measure system that user’s number value is being converted from.

Navigation between app's conversion features is implemented by convenient bottom navigation bar. This bar also has a button that launches calculator app installed on user's device.

Elements in result table are also responsive to long taps. This action will copy numeric value of chosen element to device's clipboard.

The app could be especially helpful for travelers who are not used to Metric or Imperial measure systems and want to quickly turn scary unfamiliar values into something they understand. Currency converter also becomes very handy when there is a need (or curiosity) in comparing approximate prices on goods or services in different countries.
